                <h2>Srinivasa Ramanujan</h2>
                <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan (22 December 1887 – 26 April 1920) was an Indian mathematician who lived during the British Rule in India. Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems then considered unsolvable. Ramanujan initially developed his mathematical research in isolation: "He tried to interest the leading professional mathematicians in his work, but failed for the most part. What he had to show them was too novel, and additionally presented in unusual ways; they could not be bothered".</p>

                <h2>Isaac Newton</h2>
                <p>Sir Isaac Newton PRS (25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726) was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, theologian, and author  who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time and as a key figure in the scientific revolution.In Principia, Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint until it was superseded by the theory of relativity. Newton used his mathematical description of gravity to prove Kepler's laws of planetary motion, account for tides, the trajectories of comets, the precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena, eradicating doubt about the Solar System's heliocentricity.</p>

                <h2>Carl Friedrich Gauss</h2>
                <p>Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss (30 April 1777 – 23 February 1855) was a German mathematician and physicist who made significant contributions to many fields in mathematics and science.[3] Sometimes referred to as the Princeps mathematicorum (Latin for '"the foremost of mathematicians"') and "the greatest mathematician since antiquity", Gauss had an exceptional influence in many fields of mathematics and science, and is ranked among history's most influential mathematicians.Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss was born on 30 April 1777 in Brunswick (Braunschweig), in the Duchy of Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel (now part of Lower Saxony, Germany).</p>
